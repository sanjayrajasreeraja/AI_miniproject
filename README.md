# PPE Kit Detection using YOLOv5

This project focuses on detecting Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm. PPE detection is crucial in ensuring safety compliance, especially in workplaces and high-risk environments. 

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is sourced from Roboflow, a platform for creating custom datasets for computer vision applications. It consists of annotated images containing various instances of PPE kits.

## YOLOv5
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. YOLOv5 is the latest version, incorporating improvements over its predecessors. We chose YOLOv5 due to its efficiency and ease of implementation.
